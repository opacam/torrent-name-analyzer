# parse-torrent-name

> Extract media information from torrent-like filename

![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6+-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

A Python 3 only rework based on
[parse-torrent-name](https://github.com/platelminto/parse-torrent-name),
which is a [fork of Divij Bindlish work](https://github.com/divijbindlish/parse-torrent-name)
Originally based off of [this JavaScript library](https://github.com/jzjzjzj/parse-torrent-name).

Extract all possible media information from a filename. Multiple regex
rules are applied on the filename, each of which extracts appropriate
information. If a rule matches, the corresponding part
is removed from the filename. Finally, what remains is taken as the
title of the content.

### Updates on top of [/u/roidayan's work](https://github.com/roidayan/parse-torrent-name/tree/updates)

- Added multi-language support.
- Added multi-episode support.
- Added various fields (see field list below).
- Added proper subtitle support.
- Added proper support for matching episode names.
- Added support for full `YYYY-MM-DD`-type dates, usually useful for daily shows that otherwise have no episode name.
- Added support for 2020s release years.
- Added exceptions list for media with known, non-fixable issues.
- Expanded and improved matching for various fields.
- Fixed incorrect parsing of titles containing years.
- Added more tests and cleaned up previous ones.


### [/u/roidayan's work](https://github.com/roidayan/parse-torrent-name/tree/updates) on top of [/u/divijbindlish's original python port](https://github.com/divijbindlish/parse-torrent-name)

- Added support for complete season parsing (either just a full season, or a range), not just single episodes.
- Added to various fields' patterns.
- Improved season & episode matching.
- Fixed group names from having the container & bt site name.
- Added more tests.


## Why?

Online APIs by providers like
[TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api),
[TVDb](http://thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Programmers_API), and
[OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) don't react well to
queries which include any kind of extra information. To get proper results from
these APIs, only the title of the content should be provided in the search
query. The accuracy of the results can be
improved by passing in the year, which can also be extracted using this library.

## Usage

```py
import PTN

info = PTN.parse('A freakishly cool movie or TV episode')

print(info) # All details that were parsed
```

PTN works well for both movies and TV seasons & episodes. All meaningful information is
extracted and returned in a dictionary. Text which couldn't be
parsed is returned in the `excess` field.

### Movies

```py
PTN.parse('San Andreas 2015 720p WEB-DL x264 AAC-JYK')
# {
#     'group': 'JYK',
#     'title': 'San Andreas',
#     'resolution': '720p',
#     'codec': 'x264',
#     'year':  2015,
#     'audio': 'AAC',
#     'quality': 'WEB-DL'
# }

PTN.parse('The Martian 2015 540p HDRip KORSUB x264 AAC2 0-FGT')
# {
#     'group': '0-FGT',
#     'title': 'The Martian',
#     'resolution': '540p',
#     'excess': 'KORSUB',
#     'codec': 'x264',
#     'year': 2015,
#     'audio': 'AAC2',
#     'quality': 'HDRip'
# }
```

### TV episodes 

```py
PTN.parse('Mr Robot S01E05 HDTV x264-KILLERS[ettv]')
# {
#     'episode': 5,
#     'season': 1,
#     'title': 'Mr Robot',
#     'codec': 'x264',
#     'group':  'KILLERS',
#     'encoder': 'ettv',
#     'quality': 'HDTV'
# }

PTN.parse('friends.s02e01.720p.bluray-sujaidr')
# {
#     'episode': 1,
#     'season': 2,
#     'title': 'friends',
#     'resolution': '720p',
#     'group': 'sujaidr',
#     'quality': 'bluray'    
# }
```

### TV seasons

```py
PTN.parse('South Park Season 23 Complete 720p AMZN WEB-DL x264 [i_c]')
# {
#     'title': 'South Park',
#     'season': 23,
#     'resolution': '720p',
#     'codec': 'x264',
#     'quality': 'AMZN WEB-DL',
#     'encoder': 'i_c',
#     'excess': 'Complete'
# }

  
PTN.parse('The.X-Files.Complete.S01-S09.1080p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS')
# {
#     'season': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#     'title': 'The X-Files',
#     'resolution': '1080p',
#     'quality': 'BluRay',
#     'codec': 'x264',
#     'group': 'GECKOS'
# }
```

### Note

PTN does not guarantee the fields `group`, `excess`, and `episodeName`, as these 
fields might be interchanged with each other. This shoudn't affect most 
applications since episode names can be fetched from an online database 
after correctly getting the season and episode number.
