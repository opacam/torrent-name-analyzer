[Full Changelog](https://github.com/opacam/torrent-name-analyzer/compare/39ba2f0dcded7e222ca948a5021fc501167f2fe3...d3dbf4c7dcc30990b10e88e93596ca1e8afa2c8b)

  AMZN WEBRip rather than just WEBRip; we now include these in `quality`.

  multi-subtitles info that had been already parsed. They are now
  correctly removed.

- Added 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' exception, as normally the dots would
  be replaced by spaces.

  of how new tests are being added
